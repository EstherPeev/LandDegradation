Now, let's take a closer look at the map of the actors intervening in the land degradation institutional governance.

There are many different types of actors intervening in the governance of land degradation, this is only few of them. The main institutions from the United Nations system are the FAO, UNEP and UNDP, when the international environmental agreements covering partially the issue of land degradation are the CBD, UNFCCC and UNCCD. Some additional actors are present in the map such as countries particularly involved in programs, partnerships about land protection. Private actors are also present as they partner a lot with public sector and NGOs in order to implement some programs and initiative on soil degradation. Public-private partnerships are growing in number in the last years as UN institutions and governments are often lacking the funding. The ties that are linking the actors are either membership (specially states to institutions), partnerships (private and public sector with NGOs) and financing, such as UN institution to the expert group IPCC or international economic organization such as the GEF, World Bank to UN institutions. 

In this network of actors, this blog will focus on one institution in particular. The main international environmental agreement covering at least a major part of land degradation is the United Nation Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). This map helps to visualise the ties with other actor, have an overview of the complexity of the governance and also, how the institution is acting in coordination with all the others. First, it can be useful also to have an idea of where this institution is acting according to the others and what is its precise scope of actions


# Where do they act?
The infographic below is giving an overview of the main actors involved in land degradation but with their role highlighted in the issue. As land degradation main causes are related to agriculture, the infographic gives a special focus on the food system. The production, trade and consumption of food is particularly impacting the soil as intensive agriculture, the overuse of chemicals and monoculture are deteriorating the soil, the quality of food and the yields. All of that, plus the climate change intensifying the extreme weather events, drylands are at particular risks of desertification.
