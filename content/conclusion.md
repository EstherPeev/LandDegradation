Now that the issue has been defined and that the actors' network and their role in solving the issue has been showcased, a deeper analysis on the problem structure, the institution design features and the institutional participation could be exposed. This part intents to dig into the relation between the issue, UNCCD design and how does it effects the performance and efficiency of the institution. 


**1) Problem Structure**

Desertification is a complex issue as it stands at the intersection of socioeconomic and environmental drivers. One part being linked to human activities on soil such as overgrazing, deforestation, intensive agriculture, and the other being the meteorological factors such as extreme weather events, intensified by climate change ([UNISFÃ‰RA Report 2019, p.13](http://hubrural.org/IMG/pdf/unisfera_from_boom_to_dust.pdf)). 

Problem structure: => Treaty coding to include: Actors, distribution problem, enforcement problem, state of the world uncertainty, preference uncertainty, behavioral uncertainty. 

**2) Design features**

: Membership, scope, centralization, control and flexibility

**Institutional Participation** 
1) Participatory motivation => assistance to developing countries, transfer, settlement of disptue, not a global good. 

2) Participatory gap => LDN concept, specificity of obligations? targets? No enforcement mechanism?

**Performance of the Institution**

How the UNCCD has solved the issue up until now? => has been efficient or not?
