Now that the issue has been defined and that the actors' network and their role in solving the issue has been showcased, a deeper analysis on the problem structure, the institution design features and the institutional participation could be exposed. This part intents to dig into the relation between the issue, UNCCD design and how does it effects the performance and efficiency of the institution. 


# 1. Problem Structure and Design of the Institution

Desertification is a complex issue as it stands at the intersection of socioeconomic and environmental drivers. One part being linked to human activities on soil such as overgrazing, deforestation, intensive agriculture, and the other being the meteorological factors such as extreme weather events, intensified by climate change ([UNISFÉRA Report 2019, p.13](http://hubrural.org/IMG/pdf/unisfera_from_boom_to_dust.pdf)). Institutional drivers are also considerably significant as national and supranational policies have large influence on soil degradation globally. If environmental matters are not considered or land management is neglected, soil and water are negatively impacted ([Briassoulis, 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/8/2/27/htm)). The problem structure will be analyzed through [Koremonos' (2001) article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3078615?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) as well as the following description of the UNCCD design features. 


| __Problem Structure__ | __UNCCD Design features__ |
|---|---|
| A high disparity exists between those suffering from land degradation and the ones causing it. It is often the population living already in fragile areas, like drylands that will be at high risks of desertification. The actors capacities and the way they are affected by the issue is largely asymmetric. Some countries, particularly in Africa suffer from sever droughts or land desertification. | Almost states are parties to UNCCD - universal membership |
Concerning the distribution problem, the problem with desertification is that it depends both at national land policies, but also international trade agreement and climate change impacts. As an important factor is national land management, the states highly dependent on agricultural production will have high incentives to comply. Some states less dependent on their own agricultural production might want the others to comply while they might not have particular incentives to do so. This is generally the case between developing and developed countries. Therefore we can classify this problem in the prisoner's dilemma game, as well as a moderate enforcement problem because some would have incentives to comply while some other states won't. | UNCCD is about only one type of land degradation, and is specially focused on the African continent.  |
The state of knowledge on the effects and potential negative impact of desertification as well as their non action are already well known. The only issue is the potential aggravation of desertification due to the increase of extreme weather events related to climate change. It is therefore a moderate uncertainty, only some risks are recognized. | UNCCD has a low centralization level in terms of institutional tasks concentrated into one agency. The Conference of the Parties (COP), the representatives of the states meeting once every two years has this role of monitoring, and adapting the Convention if needed. The Permanent Secretariat also has some important tasks, but more in terms of facilitating the COP decisions implementation |
Preference uncertainty is not fully clear and transparent as some states would not show clearly what are their preferences. They might want others to take care of the issue while they can use their lands as they want. It is therefore contingent preferences. | Control over the institution is kept by the member states who take decision under the one Party, one vote rule. Generally, two-third majority is necessary to modify the Convention |
Finally, behavioral uncertainty is also moderate, at the border of high, as it is really difficult to check all countries rate of land desertification. It is requiring important monitoring and scientific capacities. | Flexibility is not a feature of UNCCD as no provision mention the adaption to extraordinary events. Transformative or adaptive clauses do not exist in the Convention. |

To conclude this part, desertification is a global issue but it requires all the states actors actions, from the ones being directly affected by severe desertification through better land management policies, to the ones that make bilateral or multilateral agreements on agricultural commodities trade, and therefore putting indirect pressure on lands. The issue is known enough to ensure that sustainable agricultural practices could reduce the issue, but external factors such as lack of capacities, lack of comprehensive land policies or lack of political will are severely threatening the path to land degradation neutrality. UNCCD attempts to englobes all the different drivers pressuring on the african region particularly, but as we will see, other institutional design are posing serious problem to the well implementation of the Convention.

# 2. Institutional Participation
1) Participatory motivation => assistance to developing countries, transfer, settlement of disptue, not a global good. 

2) Participatory gap => LDN concept, specificity of obligations? targets? No enforcement mechanism?

Given the implementation problems recorded over time, COP8 [41] approved a 10-year strategy to improve UNCCD implementation and secure adequate financing that prioritizes the integration of desertification concerns into development planning and policies. The most important development since that time is perhaps the agreement of the parties to endorse Target 15.3 of SDG 15 that states “By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world” [3].9 Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) was defined as “A state whereby the amount and quality of land resources, necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security, remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems” [27], (p.33).

# 3. Overall performance of UNCCD?

How the UNCCD has solved the issue up until now? => has been efficient or not?
