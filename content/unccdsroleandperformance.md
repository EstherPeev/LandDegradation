Now that the issue has been defined and that the actors' network and their role in solving the issue has been showcased, a deeper analysis on the problem structure, the institution design features and the institutional participation could be exposed. This part intents to dig into the relation between the issue, UNCCD design and how does it effects the performance and effectiveness of the institution. 

# 1. Concept definition

Some specific concepts in this section will be used, which would require some clarification before moving on to the analysis part. The effectiveness has been often used in order to asses an institution. One common definition of effectiveness is:

> the extent to which institutions contribute to solving or mitigating the problems that motivate those people who create it ([Young, 2011](https://www.pnas.org/content/108/50/19853)).

In our case, it would be to see how land desertification rate has decreased since the signature of the Convention. It must be compare to the expectations and goals described in the Convention. It is slightly different from the performance concept which could help evaluate institutions in a better way when goals are not clearly defined. Performance takes into consideration internal operations and how the institution mobilize resources ([Gutner, 2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-010-9096-z)). This makes performance more complex to assess, but it allows to take into consideration more factors, such as the capacity of the institution, the internal processes of the external constraints to evaluate the institutions' results. Here, the effectiveness of the institution will be assessed as it is only a quick overview of the institution analysis. This is therefore to keep in mind that the time and space constraint did not allow to dig deeper in the performance evaluation but effectiveness is already a fair measurement for this level of analysis. 


# 2. Problem Structure and Design of the Institution

Desertification is a complex issue as it stands at the intersection of socioeconomic and environmental drivers. One part being linked to human activities on soil such as overgrazing, deforestation, intensive agriculture, and the other being the meteorological factors such as extreme weather events, intensified by climate change ([UNISFÉRA Report 2019, p.13](http://hubrural.org/IMG/pdf/unisfera_from_boom_to_dust.pdf)). Institutional drivers are also considerably significant as national and supranational policies have large influence on soil degradation globally. If environmental matters are not considered or land management is neglected, soil and water are negatively impacted ([Briassoulis, 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/8/2/27/htm)). The problem structure will be analyzed through [Koremonos' (2001) article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3078615?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) as well as the following description of the UNCCD design features. 


| __Problem Structure__ | __UNCCD Design features__ |
|---|---|
| A high disparity exists between those suffering from land degradation and the ones causing it. It is often the population living already in fragile areas, like drylands that will be at high risks of desertification. The actors capacities and the way they are affected by the issue is largely asymmetric. Some countries, particularly in Africa suffer from sever droughts or land desertification. | Almost states are parties to UNCCD - universal membership |
Concerning the distribution problem, the problem with desertification is that it depends both at national land policies, but also international trade agreement and climate change impacts. As an important factor is national land management, the states highly dependent on agricultural production will have high incentives to comply. Some states less dependent on their own agricultural production might want the others to comply while they might not have particular incentives to do so. This is generally the case between developing and developed countries. Therefore we can classify this problem in the prisoner's dilemma game, as well as a moderate enforcement problem because some would have incentives to comply while some other states won't. | UNCCD is about only one type of land degradation, and is specially focused on the African continent.  |
The state of knowledge on the effects and potential negative impact of desertification as well as their non action are already well known. The only issue is the potential aggravation of desertification due to the increase of extreme weather events related to climate change. It is therefore a moderate uncertainty, only some risks are recognized. | UNCCD has a low centralization level in terms of institutional tasks concentrated into one agency. The Conference of the Parties (COP), the representatives of the states meeting once every two years has this role of monitoring, and adapting the Convention if needed. The Permanent Secretariat also has some important tasks, but more in terms of facilitating the COP decisions implementation |
Preference uncertainty is not fully clear and transparent as some states would not show clearly what are their preferences. They might want others to take care of the issue while they can use their lands as they want. It is therefore contingent preferences. | Control over the institution is kept by the member states who take decision under the one Party, one vote rule. Generally, two-third majority is necessary to modify the Convention |
Finally, behavioral uncertainty is also moderate, at the border of high, as it is really difficult to check all countries rate of land desertification. It is requiring important monitoring and scientific capacities. | Flexibility is not a feature of UNCCD as no provision mention the adaption to extraordinary events. Transformative or adaptive clauses do not exist in the Convention. |

To conclude this part, desertification is a global issue but it requires all the states actors actions, from the ones being directly affected by severe desertification through better land management policies, to the ones that make bilateral or multilateral agreements on agricultural commodities trade, and therefore putting indirect pressure on lands. The scientific knowledge on the issue is developed enough to ensure that sustainable agricultural practices could reduce the problem, but external factors such as lack of capacities, lack of comprehensive land policies or lack of political are severely threatening the path to land degradation neutrality. UNCCD attempts to englobes all the different drivers pressuring on the African region particularly, but as we will see, other institutional design are posing serious problem to the well implementation of the Convention.

# 3. Institutional Participation

### Motivation

This section is taking [Bernauer's article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-013-9165-1) about the "Depth versus Participation" dilemma as lens to read states' motivation in participating in UNCCD institution. There are two important things to understand. The first thing is what were states motivation to join UNCCD, why so many states signed the convention, knowing that it is almost a universal membership. The second is to understand why with all the states participating in the institution, the land desertification rate is still highly alarming. This part attempts to analyze the relationship between states and the institution features design. 

According to [Bernauer's article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-013-9165-1), there are different reasons why states will be willing to join an institution. In that case, some specific clauses have been identified as improving states' participation: 

A. Assistance to developing countries. This is a highly important feature of UNCCD. Almost the whole convention is gravitating around developed countries responsibility to assist developing countries. This helps particularly the developing countries signing to environmental agreement, and developed countries are more inclined to sign as they push more for environmental protection. 

B. Transfer of technology. It is related to the first point increase states' participation. UNCCD also provides a whole set of clauses on how "transfer, acquisition and development of technology ([art.18 UNCCD](https://www.unccd.int/sites/default/files/relevant-links/2017-01/UNCCD_Convention_ENG_0.pdf)). This facilitates the transfer of technology to countries that would not have the capacities to fight desertification. 

C. Settlement of dispute. UNCCD also has a clause on the settlement of disputes ([art.28 UNCCD](https://www.unccd.int/sites/default/files/relevant-links/2017-01/UNCCD_Convention_ENG_0.pdf)). This brings more transparency and states know that there will be easy and impartial way of solve disagreements. 


### Main participatory gaps

While membership is almost universal, a major gap in implementation exists. Poor results have been observed after the convention was signed ([Briassoulis 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/8/2/27/htm)). Few reasons could explain the institution inefficiency despite the high number of signatories. 

A. Low specificity of obligations. UNCCD has been criticized because of the lack of specific target ([NAP evaluation 2015](https://www.unccd.int/sites/default/files/relevant-links/2017-01/NAP%20evaluation_0.pdf)). All member states have to develop National Action Plan but no specific target has been defined which increase the number of states joining the institution, but poses serious problem when it comes to efficiency of the institution in solving the issue. It really reflects the depth vs participation dilemma described by Bernauer. 

B. No enforcement mechanism. There is no strong enforcement mechanism ensure through UNCCD. This variable has not been found as really influential on states' motivation in Bernauer's article findings, it is however important to mention it here, as it means incentives to implement the Convention remain low. 

The Convention features are therefore perfect to attract many states, but is missing key elements to ensure the "depth" side of the Convention. The clauses remain broad and do not provide enough incentives for effective implementation. The lack of clear target to achieve in a given period of time could drastically increase the chances of better land protection, but states are not yet at the stage of revising the Convention in that sense. 

A solution would be to implement a time limit for states to reach the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). LDN is defined as:

> “A state whereby the amount and quality of land resources, necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security, remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems”  ([Briassoulis, 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/8/2/27/htm))

This concept has been particularly emphasized through the target 15.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which is the part of 17 SDGs adopted by the United Nations which all together aim to end poverty and protect the planet by 2030 ([UNDP, 2021](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals)). The concept has gained considerable attention during the last years and could represent a potential solution to have better clear targets to achieve for states. That means, however, that considerable efforts should be taken to modify and adopt this new targets through UNCCD institutional framework.
