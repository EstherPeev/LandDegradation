Now, let's take a look at the map of the actors intervening in the land degradation institutional governance.

![](images/actorsmap.png)

There are many different types of actors intervening in the governance of land degradation. 

###### Main points presented:
- Different actors intervening => look at the institutions more closely (FAO, UNEP, UNDP, UNFCCC, CBD but more importantly, UNCCD => treating specifically land degradation! 
- Emphasize on UNCCD => for this blog, this was the choice I made, see the role of the institution in this actors network. 


The infographic below is giving an overview of the main actors involved in land degradation. Special focus is given to agriculture factors => give emphasize on the main cause of land degradation. How important this driver is. The only convention treating specifically about land degradation is UNCCD. 

###### Main points presented:
- The relationship between the problem and the institutions => UNCCD roles => neglect the parts 
- **Also reworked slightly the infograph to highlight UNCCD role (and what the convention is not covering specifically => desertification is only one type of land degradation!)**
