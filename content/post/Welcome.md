> Land degradation is a very complex environmental issue that demands in-deep analysis to understand what are the roles of the actors in the institutional governance and what is the biggest challenge they face. This blog aims to dive into this particular issue to highlight the institutions role what they should overcome to solve this issue. The analysis will be in three different parts, one focused on the issue and the related causes and consequences, then one on the actors themselves and the network they represent, and a last one on the institutions that is tempting to solve the issue, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.
