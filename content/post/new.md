First, let's first dive into the different definitions of land degradation. They can differ depending on the sources and the emphasize given for certain elements. According to the [IPCC 2019 report](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2019/11/07_Chapter-4.pdf), land degradation could be define as such:

> Land degradation is a negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes including anthropogenic climate change, expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least one of the following: biological productivity, ecological integrity or value to humans.
