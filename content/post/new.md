First, let's first dive into the different definitions of land degradation. They can differ depending on the sources which gives emphasis for certain elements more than other.

According to the [IPCC 2019 report](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2019/11/07_Chapter-4.pdf), land degradation could be defined as such:

> Land degradation is a negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes including anthropogenic climate change, expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least one of the following: biological productivity, ecological integrity or value to humans.

In other terms, land degradation is the deterioration of the soils' quality which is caused either by human or by nature. In this blog, we will focus on human-induced land degradation which represents the large majority of land degradation.

Another definition, emphasizing more on the land value is given by [Barrow in 1991](https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19916778502) and describes land degradation as the loss of utility or potential utility, or reduction, loss, or change of features or organisms which cannot be replaced.
