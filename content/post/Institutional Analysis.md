**Problem Structure and design features analysis**
1) Problem structure: => Treaty coding to include: Actors, distribution problem, enforcement problem, state of the world uncertainty, preference uncertainty, behavioral uncertainty. 

2) Design features: Membership, scope, centralization, control and flexibility

**Institutional Participation** 
1) Participatory motivation => assistance to developing countries, transfer, settlement of disptue, not a global good. 

2) Participatory gap => LDN concept, specificity of obligations? targets? No enforcement mechanism?

**Performance of the Institution**

How the UNCCD has solved the issue up until now? => has been efficient or not?
