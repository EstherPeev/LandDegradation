According to [recent studies](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/ipbes-land-degradation-environmental-damage-report-spd), approximately 75% of the world's land area is significantly degraded. With the population growth and the consumption level increasing in developing countries, demand for food and therefore arable land will keep increase. The food system is indeed responsible for a large part of land degradation as the main causes are the intensification of agriculture production, overgrazing, deforestation, fuelwood overconsumption, urbanization ([UNISFÃ‰RA 2005](http://hubrural.org/IMG/pdf/unisfera_from_boom_to_dust.pdf)). As globalization and more specifically trade liberalization in agricultural commodities continue to nourish the main drivers of land degradation, institutions have been created to respond to this specific issue and intent to coordinate actions between states to tackle the challenge.

First, let's first dive into the different definitions of land degradation. They can differ depending on the sources which gives emphasis for certain elements more than other.

According to the [IPCC 2019 report](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2019/11/07_Chapter-4.pdf), land degradation could be defined as such:

> Land degradation is a negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes including anthropogenic climate change, expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least one of the following: biological productivity, ecological integrity or value to humans.

In other terms, land degradation is the deterioration of the soils' quality which is caused either by human or by nature. In this blog, we will focus on human-induced land degradation which represents the large majority of land degradation.

Another definition, emphasizing more on the land value is given by [Barrow in 1991](https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19916778502) and describes land degradation as:

> The loss of utility or potential utility, or reduction, loss, or change of features or organisms which cannot be replaced. 

##### Land degradation and desertification

As one of the institution analyzed in this blog is the UNCCD, it is important to understand the difference between land degradation and desertification. As highlighted on [FAO's website](http://www.fao.org/3/v4360e/v4360e03.htm#:~:text=type%20of%20degradation.-,Types%20of%20land%20degradation%20assessed,lowering%20of%20the%20water%20table.), desertification is a type of land degradation in aria, semi-arid and dry subhumid areas caused by human. 

Land degradation is generally divided into six categories, according to FAO. These six categories concerns specifically the soil deterioration such as:

**1) Water erosion**

**2) Wind erosion**

**3) Soil fertility decline**

**4) Waterlogging**

**5) Salinization**

**6) Lowering of the water table**

Other land degradation encompasses some that are more related to the cause such as:
- **Deforestation**
- **Forest degradation**
- **Rangeland degradation**

To better understand the process in which the land is degraded and why it is such an important environmental issue, please watch the full video below produced by FAO.
