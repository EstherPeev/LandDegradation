##  What will you learn in this blog?


> Land degradation is a very complex environmental issue that demands in-deep analysis to understand what are the roles of the actors in the institutional governance and what is the biggest challenge they face. This blog aims to dive into this particular issue to highlight the institutions' role and what they should overcome to solve this issue. The analysis will be in four different parts. The two first parts will be more descriptive and focused on the definitions of the concepts and the actors network. The third part presents the institutions's role, with a special focus on the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the analysis of the performance and efficiency in solving the problem. The last part  focuses on some suggestions and ideas on how institutions features could be adapted to better respond to the issue.
