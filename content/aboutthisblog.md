##  What will you learn here?


> Land degradation is a very complex environmental issue and solutions to stop its worrying increase are numerous but hard to realize. Why land degradation is such an important topic in the environment field? What are the solutions states are trying to implement? How well does that work? How do international environmental institutions have been created to respond to the issue and how do they perform? This blog aims to dive into this particular issue, with the central line of what is the biggest challenge states and institutions they have created to tackle land degradation have to face? For a matter of space, the analysis will focus on one specific institution that have been created to respond to one type of land degradation, desertification. The institutional framework that will be studied here is the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), established in 1994. The relationship between this specific issue and the institutional response will be at the center of the blog, while the main challenges faced will be strongly highlighted. Let's start with an overview of the land degradation environmental problem.
