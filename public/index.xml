      <description>Land degradation is a very complex environmental issue that demands in-deep analysis to understand what are the roles of the actors in the institutional governance and what is the biggest challenge they face. This blog aims to dive into this particular issue to highlight the institutions&#39; role and what they should overcome to solve this issue. The analysis will be in four different parts. The two first parts will be more descriptive and focused on the definitions of the concepts and the actors network.</description>

      <description>According to recent studies, approximately 75% of the world&amp;rsquo;s land area is already degraded. With the population growth and the consumption level increasing in developing countries, demand for food and therefore arable land will keep increase. The food system is indeed responsible for a large part of land degradation as the main causes are the intensification of agriculture production, overgrazing, deforestation, but fuelwood overconsumption and urbanization are also important factors(UNISFÃ‰RA 2005).</description>

      <description>Now, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the map of the actors intervening in the land degradation institutional governance.
There are many different types of actors intervening in the governance of land degradation.
Main points presented:  Different actors intervening =&amp;gt; look at the institutions more closely (FAO, UNEP, UNDP, UNFCCC, CBD but more importantly, UNCCD =&amp;gt; treating specifically land degradation! Emphasize on UNCCD =&amp;gt; for this blog, this was the choice I made, see the role of the institution in this actors network.</description>

      <description>Now that the issue has been defined and that the actors&#39; network and their role in solving the issue has been showcased, a deeper analysis on the problem structure, the institution design features and the institutional participation could be exposed. This part intents to dig into the relation between the issue, UNCCD design and how does it effects the performance and efficiency of the institution.
1) Problem Structure
Desertification is a complex issue as it stands at the intersection of socioeconomic and environmental drivers.</description>
